# Ideas

Initially, the idea was that a user could request an official digital version of their
document from one of the Authority offices available (these institutions are the network
  validators if using PoA concensus algorithm). However, thinking about it now,
  I think it would be possible for the user to upload their own documents if they have
  them and that digital version will need to be validated by the official institutions.
  The validating institution will check information in the document and compare it to
  its own records. If everything matches, then the upload will be validated. Since the
  network can have many validators, in this case I think it would make sense to have a
  private network for each type of document, since any validator will not be related to
  the topic at hand. There should be some mechanism for sharing information from one
  network to the other, though. If a company requires a certain type of document that lives
  in a different chain, they should be able to easily obtain that information, as long as
  the user has approved the transaction.

## On Choosing validators
The validators for a certain chain should be the institutions that issue those types of documents
in the physical world. Additionally, there are many documents that are not directly related to
the government but they still require governmental approval. Maybe it makes sense that the
government is a validator in many of the chains. On the other hand, different branches of the
government could create a validator node on the respective chain of interest.

## On Payments
The system can be run on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and maybe use ETH as the way of
paying for services (notaries, sending and processing documents, etc). Another possibiliy
is to use an internal coin (we call it PI Coin for now) that can be used to pay.
It is also important to design a way of feeding the coins back to the users, so that it remains
useful. What I mean is that if the coin is used as a one-way vehicle (users pay institutions to
  issue a document) then institutions have no way of using the coin, or they simply can hoard them.
Meanwhile, users need to keep purchasing the coin somehow to be able to use it.

## On Adoption
In order for users and institutions to start using our system we need to implement user-friendly
applications. Mobile apps and web sites can be a good idea. The interface should be as clear and
straightforward as possible.
